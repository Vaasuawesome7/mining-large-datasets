# Mining of massive datasets

## A python implementation of the Apriori, PCY, Multistage and Multihash algorithms

To run a particular algorithm, cd into that directory and run '**python index.py**'. **index.py** has a collection of all passes for all the algorithms and prints the result of each pass (i.e., item index table, the frequent k sets, etc.). For the given sample dataset, we do not require more than 3 passes and hence we stop after checking for candidate tripletons
